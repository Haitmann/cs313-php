            <p>My name is Diogo Haitmann and I live in Brazil, I was born in SÃ£o Paulo city, but  currently live in 1 hour far from there. I served a mission here in my country from 2006 to 2008, and I had a great time there, I learned a lot and loved serving those people and the Lord. I've been married for about 8 year, and has just 3 weeks since we discovered my wife is finally pregnant, and the blessing came in double, we'll have twins. I current work in an American company called 3M, where I play the role as Sales Intelligence specialist. I love all kind of sports and outdoor activities and every time I have a chance, I go to a new adventure.</p><br>
